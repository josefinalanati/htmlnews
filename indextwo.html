        A city official said the measures would help keep residents and visitors safe over the holiday 
        period

        A state of emergency has been declared in the US city of Miami Beach over concerns large 
        crowds gathering for spring break pose a coronavirus risk.
        A 20:00-06:00 curfew has been announced in the island city 
        that will remain in effect until at least 12 April.
       </p>
       <p>
        Traffic restrictions are in place during the curfew, while businesses in the busy South Beach area
        must close. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said thousands of tourists had brought 
        "chaos and disorder" to the city. "It feels like a rock concert, wall-to-wall people over blocks 
        and blocks," Mr Gelber told CNN. "If you're coming here to go crazy, go somewhere else."
        Spring break is a holiday period for schools and universities in the US that usually 
        takes place in March or April. It attracts thousands of students to Florida and other 
        warm-weather destinations around the country.
       </p>

        Officials warned tourists to "vacation responsibly or be arrested" 
        prior to the holiday period, and a county-wide midnight coronavirus curfew was already
        in place due to the pandemic. But the Miami Beach area was thronged with revellers 
        over the weekend, and many did not appear to be wearing masks or socially distancing.

      One city official described South Beach, which includes the world-famous 
      Ocean Drive, as being "overwhelmed" by crowds on Saturday.
      "You couldn't see pavement and you couldn't see grass," city manager Raul Aguila said.
     </p>
     <p>
      He added that the emergency measures were "necessary not only to protect our residents but our 
      visitors, including our spring breakers who we want to keep safe".
      On Sunday, Miami Beach police
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/20/us/miami-beach-crowds-clevelander-covid/index.html">
      told CNN</a> 
      they had arrested at least a dozen people after
      the curfew had come into force. 
      <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article250102479.html">
      The Miami Herlad newspaper</a> 
      said police used pepper-spray 
      balls to enforce the curfew.

      Until the measures are lifted, police will prevent pedestrians and vehicles
      from entering the South Beach area's main party strips. On Sunday, the Miami Beach city commission 
      voted to extend the curfew and other measures for up to three more weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      At an emergency meeting, Mayor Gelber told the commission South Beach had become
      "a tinder over the last couple of weeks". He said tourists had flooded into the city 
      since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the state an "oasis of freedom" from coronavirus
      restrictions late last month.

      Florida continues to be a coronavirus hotspot in the US. The state has recorded nearly 
      two million of the country's 29 million infections since the pandemic began. 
      <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#compare-trends_newcases"> 
      The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> shows Florida 
      has recorded about 4,300 new infections a day on average over the past week.
